# Continuous-Integration
Objective of this exercise is to learn continuous build process (CB) and continuous integration (CI). 
You are expected to: 

- Write python program to convert Arabic Numerals to Roman Numerals 
- Integrate Continuous Build Process to check if your software in each development stage passed the build process. 
- Integrate unit test and run the unit test in continuous integration process.

For more informaiton, please check the assignment presentation.

Deadline for completion of this project is January 29th, 2019. 
You are expected to show all aspects of your work. This includes results of build process. 
You are expected to use Github actively during this exercise.

# The Process of Hanchen Zhang's Excercise:
1. Finshed the python program called aratorom.py that convert the arabic number to roman numerals.
2. Github Action has already implemented.

# Additional Information
This number converter could only handle integer in the range of 1 to 3999 since larger number contains unknown lable in the python program.
